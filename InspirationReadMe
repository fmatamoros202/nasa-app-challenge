This was a exciting challenge to undertake. Before this project, I didn't have that much knowledge about javascript but I did my best 
to self-learn and apply what I could in the little time I had. To be honest, I started this challenge just 6 days ago but I'm proud of my results. 
I hope that you can share your best advices and best practices that can become applicable to my coding. 
Thanks again for taking the time.
All the Best,
Fernando
